# r k\Websitehelper 0.4.0

You have three helper so far. One is an image collection. These images might be used somewhere on the website. The other one is a carousel. Here you can add some items which will slide around. The third one is the linker. The linker is used to add some boostrap boxes on you website.

This module is intended for being used with Zikula 1.4.4 and later.
