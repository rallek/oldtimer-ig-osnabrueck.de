# INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1. Copy RKSponsoringModule into your modules directory. Afterwards you should have a folder named `modules/RK/SponsoringModule/Resources`.
2. Initialize and activate RKSponsoringModule in the modules administration.
3. Move or copy the directory `Resources/userdata/RKSponsoringModule/` to `/userdata/RKSponsoringModule/`.
   Note this step is optional as the install process can create these folders, too.
4. Make the directory `/userdata/RKSponsoringModule/` writable including all sub folders.
